# Interface Proposal

This repository contains our proposal for the interface between the Virus and WHO models.

The interface is designed with the attempt to have no bias as to the implementation of both the virus of WHO models. The concepts presented in this document are intended to be interpreted as abstractions over the function of the models themselves, they are not meant to be considered as a reference for the implementation of either the virus or WHO models.
