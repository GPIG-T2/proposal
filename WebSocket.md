# WebSocket Outline

This document outlines the WebSocket interface version of this proposal.

##Â Messages

Each message is made of a single base `[Request](websocket.ts#L41)` object. This object can be in 4 forms:

- Get
- Create
- Update
- Delete

Each message form is distingushed by the `kind` property. The `reference` property is the reference string of the data you are attempting to manage, and the `specifics` property is used to list the IDs of any specific objects you are attempting to fetch.

Messages are responded to using the `[Response](websocket.ts#L58)` object. This object will have the `data` property set if it succeeded, or the `error` property set if the request failed.

Every request and reponse has a `nonce` property, which is a custom string set by the request message to keep track of the response message (in order to allow asyncronous messaging if needed).
